## Introduction
We present a large-scale benchmark of **72 confounder-aware differential abundance analysis (DAA) strategies**, assembled from six input schemes (five normalization approaches plus raw counts) and 14 statistical models. 
<!-- 
- We systematically evaluate precision and sensitivity to identify **top performers** across 250 simulated scenarios.We then validate these strategies on three real-world datasets with approximate ground truth and assess cross-dataset consistency in 36 metagenomic datasets. We further probe robustness to sample size, prevalence, feature-effect magnitude, and the number, type, and strength of confounders.
- Beyond single-cohort evaluation, we further integrate the selected strategies with meta- or mega-analysis frameworks, evaluating both simulated batch-affected settings and real cohorts to recommend effective, **batch-robust DAA pipelines**.

We also provided **a DAA strategy benchmarking pipeline** that helps researchers choose an optimal strategy and integration framework for their datasets, and then execute the selected methods end to end to obtain robust differential microbes. 

* We provide a step-by-step **tutorial** with sample data for quick, reproducible use. 
* The pipeline is also available on the **xConDA** webserver.
